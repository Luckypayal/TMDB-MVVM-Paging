    <string name="dummyText">"To uniquely identify a view and reference it from your code, you must give it an id. The android:id attribute lets you specify a unique id â€” a resource identifier for a view. For example: android:id=\"@+id/button_count\" The \"@+id/button_count\" part of the above attribute creates a new id called button_count for the view. You use the plus ( + ) symbol to indicate that you are creating a new id . Referencing a view To refer to an existing resource identifier, omit the plus ( + ) symbol. For example, to refer to a view by its id in another attribute, such as android:layout_toLeftOf (described in the next section) to control the position of a view, you would use: android:layout_toLeftOf=\"@id/show_count\" In the above attribute, \"@id/show_count\" refers to the view with the resource identifier show_count . The attribute positions the view to be \"to the left of\" the show_count view. "</string>
    <string name="dummyOverView">After leaving their cave, the Croods encounter their biggest threat since leaving: another family called the Bettermans, who claim and show to be better and evolved. Grug grows suspicious of the Betterman parents, Phil and Hope, as they secretly plan to break up his daughter Eep with her loving boyfriend Guy to ensure that their daughter Dawn has a loving and smart partner to protect her. Searching for a safer habitat, the prehistoric Crood family discovers an idyllic, walled-in paradise that meets all of its needs. Unfortunately, they must also learn to live with the Bettermans -- a family that\'s a couple of steps above the Croods on the evolutionary ladder. As tensions between the new neighbors start to rise, a new threat soon propels both clans on an epic adventure that forces them to embrace their differences, draw strength from one another, and survive together.</string>
